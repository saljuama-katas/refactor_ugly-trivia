# Refactor Kata: Ugly Trivia

Language: Python

__NOTE__: The code before starting the refactor is available at the git tag `start`. If you want to try on your own, 
you can do it in a different branch by running: 
```
git checkout tags/start -b <branch-name> 
```

## Description

This exercise comes without a description, so it emulates a situation where there is no documentation or on-boarding
available.

### Goal 

Find improvement opportunities without any guidance and apply them. Think and reason about these improvements, is the 
effort spent on those justified? what is the added value?
